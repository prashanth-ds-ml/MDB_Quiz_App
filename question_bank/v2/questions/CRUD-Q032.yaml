prompt: 'Using the inspections collection within the sample_training database, you need to find all inspections
  that were passed. Your manager has requested that you organize this data by the certificate number in ascending
  order. Which query should you use? (Select one.)

  '
context: 'The documents are stored in the `inspections` collection.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs:
  - _id: ObjectId('5f6a...')
    certificate_number: 3045325
    result: Pass
  notes:
  - Sorting is applied using the sort() method.
  - Ascending order is specified using 1.
choices:
- key: A
  text: "db.inspections\n  .find({ result: \"Pass\" })\n  .sort({ certificate_number: 1 });\n"
- key: B
  text: "db.inspections\n  .find({ result: \"Pass\" })\n  .sort({ certificate_number: -1 });\n"
- key: C
  text: "db.inspections.find(\n  { result: \"Pass\" },\n  { sort: { certificate_number: 1 } }\n);\n"
- key: D
  text: "db.inspections.find(\n  { result: \"Pass\" },\n  { sort: { certificate_number: -1 } }\n);\n"
answer:
  keys:
  - A
rationale:
  rule: 'Use the sort() method after find() to order query results.

    '
  correct_why:
  - Filters only passed inspections.
  - 'sort({ certificate_number: 1 }) sorts in ascending order.'
  - Uses correct MongoDB method chaining.
  wrong_why:
    B: Sorts the results in descending order.
    C: The second argument to find() is for projections, not sorting.
    D: Incorrect sort placement and descending order.
  trap: 'Attempting to use sort as a projection inside find().
