prompt: 'Your company is conducting research on customer experience and needs to identify unsatisfied customers.
  You need to find all customers with a satisfaction rating of 1 or 2. Which of the following query documents would
  return all such customers?

  '
context: 'The satisfaction rating is stored as a numeric field inside a nested document called `customer`.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs: []
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - Use dot notation to query nested fields ("parent.child").
  - $lte means less than or equal to.
  - To include both 1 and 2, the comparison must allow equality.
choices:
- key: A
  text: '{ "customer.satisfaction": { $gt: 1 } }'
- key: B
  text: '{ customer.satisfaction: { $lte: 2 } }'
- key: C
  text: '{ "customer.satisfaction": { $lt: 2 } }'
- key: D
  text: '{ "customer.satisfaction": { $lte: 2 } }'
answer:
  keys:
  - D
rationale:
  rule: 'To match a range that includes the boundary value, use $lte or $gte.

    '
  correct_why:
  - '$lte: 2 matches all values less than or equal to 2.'
  - This correctly returns customers with satisfaction ratings of 1 or 2.
  - Dot notation is used correctly to access the nested field.
  wrong_why:
    A: '$gt: 1 returns values greater than 1, which includes satisfied customers.'
    B: Dot notation is missing quotes, making the query syntactically incorrect.
    C: '$lt: 2 excludes customers with a rating of exactly 2.'
  trap: 'Forgetting equality when the question explicitly includes boundary values (\"1 or 2\").
