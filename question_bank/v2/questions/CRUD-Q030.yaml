prompt: 'United Airlines is the only airline that has a route from the Denver Airport (DEN) to the Northwest Arkansas
  Airport (XNA). It has decided to cancel this route due to low ridership. Which of the following queries will delete
  the route? (Select one.)

  '
context: 'The documents are stored in the `routes` collection of the `sample_training` database.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs:
  - _id: ObjectId('5f6a...')
    airline:
      name: United Airlines
    src_airport: DEN
    dst_airport: XNA
    stops: 0
  notes:
  - deleteOne() removes a single matched document.
  - Route identity is determined by src_airport and dst_airport.
choices:
- key: A
  text: 'db.routes.deleteOne({ "airline.name": "United Airlines" })'
- key: B
  text: 'db.routes.delete({ "airline.name": "United Airlines" })'
- key: C
  text: 'db.routes.delete({ src_airport: "DEN", dst_airport: "XNA" })'
- key: D
  text: 'db.routes.deleteOne({ src_airport: "DEN", dst_airport: "XNA" })'
answer:
  keys:
  - D
rationale:
  rule: 'Use deleteOne() with a precise filter to remove a single, specific document.

    '
  correct_why:
  - Filters exactly match the DEN → XNA route.
  - deleteOne() ensures only one document is removed.
  - Avoids deleting unrelated United Airlines routes.
  wrong_why:
    A: Matches airline only, not a specific route.
    B: '`delete()` is not a valid MongoDB method.'
    C: '`delete()` is not a valid MongoDB method.'
  trap: 'Deleting by airline name instead of route identifiers.
