prompt: 'Your company wants to offer a special discount for customers who are 65 or older. Your task is to find
  the records for these customers. Which of the following queries would return documents for all customers aged
  65 or older?

  '
context: 'Customer age is stored as a numeric field inside a nested document named `customer`.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs: []
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - Use dot notation ("customer.age") to query nested fields.
  - $gte includes the boundary value.
  - $gt can also be used if you shift the boundary logically.
choices:
- key: A
  text: '{ customer.age: { $gte: 65 } }'
- key: B
  text: '{ "customer.age": { $gt: 64 } }'
- key: C
  text: '{ "customer.age": { $gte: 65 } }'
- key: D
  text: '{ "customer.age": { $lte: 65 } }'
answer:
  keys:
  - B
  - C
rationale:
  rule: '“65 or older” means age ≥ 65.

    '
  correct_why:
  - 'Option B works because $gt: 64 is logically equivalent to age ≥ 65.'
  - 'Option C directly expresses the requirement using $gte: 65.'
  - Both correctly include customers who are exactly 65.
  wrong_why:
    A: Missing quotes around the dotted field path makes the query invalid syntax.
    D: '$lte: 65 returns customers aged 65 or younger, not older.'
  trap: 'Mixing up $lte and $gte, or forgetting that $gt: 64 is equivalent to $gte: 65.

    '
  mini_demo: '# Two correct ways

    db.customers.find({ "customer.age": { $gte: 65 } })

    db.customers.find({ "customer.age": { $gt: 64 } })
