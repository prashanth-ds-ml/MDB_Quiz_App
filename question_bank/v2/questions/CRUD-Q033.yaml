prompt: 'You are considering creating a new membership tier for your bike sharing service for users who take long
  trips. Using the trips collection within the sample_training database, you need to find the trips taken by subscribers
  with the longest trip duration. Return the top 5 results in descending order. Which query should you use? (Select
  one.)

  '
context: 'The documents are stored in the `trips` collection.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs:
  - _id: ObjectId('5f6a...')
    usertype: Subscriber
    tripduration: 3200
  notes:
  - Descending order uses -1.
  - sort() and limit() must be chained after find().
choices:
- key: A
  text: "db.trips.find(\n  { usertype: \"Subscriber\" },\n  { sort: { tripduration: -1 } },\n  { limit: 5 }\n)\n"
- key: B
  text: "db.trips.find(\n  { usertype: \"Subscriber\" },\n  { sort: { tripduration: 1 } },\n  { limit: 5 }\n)\n"
- key: C
  text: "db.trips\n  .find({ usertype: \"Subscriber\" })\n  .sort({ tripduration: 1 })\n  .limit(5)\n"
- key: D
  text: "db.trips\n  .find({ usertype: \"Subscriber\" })\n  .sort({ tripduration: -1 })\n  .limit(5)\n"
answer:
  keys:
  - D
rationale:
  rule: 'Use method chaining with sort() and limit() to order and restrict results.

    '
  correct_why:
  - Filters only Subscriber trips.
  - Sorts by tripduration in descending order.
  - limit(5) returns only the top five longest trips.
  wrong_why:
    A: find() does not accept sort and limit as separate arguments.
    B: Sorts results in ascending order instead of descending.
    C: Ascending sort returns the shortest trips.
  trap: 'Attempting to pass sort or limit as arguments to find() instead of chaining.
