  '
context: 'You are evaluating MongoDB’s schema flexibility compared to traditional relational databases.

  - _id: 1
    name: Alice
    age: 30
  - _id: 2
    product: Laptop
    price: 75000

  snippets: []
  notes:
  - MongoDB uses a flexible schema model.
  - Documents in the same collection do not need to share the same fields.
choices:
- key: A
  text: 'Yes'
- key: B
  text: 'No'
- key: C
  text: Only if all fields are optional
- key: D
  text: Only when using MongoDB Atlas
answer:
  keys:
  - A
rationale:
  rule: 'MongoDB collections can contain documents with different structures.

    '
  correct_why:
  - MongoDB is schema-flexible and does not enforce a fixed structure.
  - Each document can have different fields and data types.
  - This is a core feature of the MongoDB document model.
  wrong_why:
    B: MongoDB does not require all documents to have the same shape.
    C: Field optionality is not required for schema flexibility.
    D: This behavior is inherent to MongoDB, not specific to Atlas.
  trap: 'Assuming MongoDB enforces a rigid schema like relational databases.
