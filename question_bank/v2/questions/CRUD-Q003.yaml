prompt: 'What methods are available in MongoDB for inserting multiple documents?

  '
context: 'You are working in the MongoDB Shell (mongosh) and need to insert more than one document into a collection
  in a single operation.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs: []
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - insertMany() is the standard method for inserting multiple documents at once.
  - insertOne() is only for a single document.
  - Bulk inserts are more efficient than repeated single inserts.
choices:
- key: A
  text: .InsertDocument()
- key: B
  text: .inserting()
- key: C
  text: .insertOne()
- key: D
  text: .insertMany()
answer:
  keys:
  - D
rationale:
  rule: 'Multiple documents → insertMany().

    '
  correct_why:
  - insertMany() is a valid MongoDB Shell method for inserting multiple documents.
  - It accepts an array of documents as input.
  - This is the correct and recommended approach for bulk inserts.
  wrong_why:
    A: InsertDocument() is not a valid MongoDB Shell method.
    B: inserting() does not exist in the MongoDB API.
    C: insertOne() can insert only a single document, not multiple.
  trap: 'Assuming insertOne() can automatically handle multiple documents if passed an array.
