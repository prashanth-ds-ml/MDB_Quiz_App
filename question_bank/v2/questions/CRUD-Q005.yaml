prompt: 'You are searching for data in a small area in downtown Chicago with the following zip codes: "60601", "60602",
  "60603", "60604", "60605", "60606". Which of the following query documents should you use to ensure that only
  the documents with the specified zip codes are returned?

  '
context: 'Each document contains a field named `zip` that stores a single ZIP code as a string.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs: []
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - $in matches documents where the field value equals ANY value in the provided array.
  - $nin is the logical opposite of $in.
  - Equality without $in can match only ONE value.
choices:
- key: A
  text: '{ zip: { $nin: ["60601", "60602", "60603", "60604", "60605", "60606"] } }'
- key: B
  text: '{ zip: { $in: ["60601", "60602", "60603", "60604", "60605", "60606"] } }'
- key: C
  text: '{ zip: { $eq: "60601", "60602", "60603", "60604", "60605", "60606" } }'
- key: D
  text: '{ zip: "60601", "60602", "60603", "60604", "60605", "60606" }'
answer:
  keys:
  - B
rationale:
  rule: 'Multiple allowed values for one field → use $in.

    '
  correct_why:
  - $in returns documents where the field matches any value in the array.
  - This ensures only the specified ZIP codes are returned.
  - This is the standard pattern tested for multi-value filters.
  wrong_why:
    A: $nin excludes the listed values instead of including them.
    C: $eq matches only one value and cannot accept multiple values.
    D: Implicit equality can match only a single value, not multiple.
  trap: 'Confusing $in with $nin or assuming equality can accept multiple values.
