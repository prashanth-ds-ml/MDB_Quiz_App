prompt: 'Which of the following statements regarding the `replaceOne()` method for the MongoDB Shell (`mongosh`)
  are true?

  '
context: 'You are updating documents using replacement semantics instead of update operators.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs: []
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - '`replaceOne()` completely replaces the matched document except for `_id`.'
  - It does NOT use update operators like `$set`.
  - Only one document can be replaced per operation.
choices:
- key: A
  text: 'This method is used to replace a single document that matches the filter document.

    '
- key: B
  text: 'This method accepts a filter document, a replacement document, and an optional options document.

    '
- key: C
  text: 'This method can replace multiple documents in a collection.

    '
- key: D
  text: 'This method returns a document containing an acknowledgement of the operation, a matched count, modified
    count, and an upserted ID (if applicable).

    '
answer:
  keys:
  - A
  - B
  - D
rationale:
  rule: 'replaceOne() replaces exactly one document and returns an operation result object.

    '
  correct_why:
  - replaceOne() targets only a single matching document.
  - Its signature is replaceOne(filter, replacement, options).
  - The result includes acknowledged, matchedCount, modifiedCount, and upsertedId.
  wrong_why:
    C: replaceOne() cannot replace multiple documents; updateMany() or bulk operations are required.
  trap: 'Confusing replaceOne() with updateMany() or assuming it behaves like update operators.

    '
