prompt: 'How should you handle a connection timeout in PyMongo?

  '
context: 'Your Python application is communicating with MongoDB using PyMongo and encounters a connection timeout
  due to network instability or temporary server unavailability.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs: []
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - Connection timeouts are typically transient failures.
  - Robust applications handle such failures gracefully.
choices:
- key: A
  text: Retry the operation
- key: B
  text: Ignore the error
- key: C
  text: Use a larger batch size
- key: D
  text: Disable connection pooling
answer:
  keys:
  - A
rationale:
  rule: 'Transient connection issues should be handled by retrying the operation.

    '
  correct_why:
  - Connection timeouts are often temporary network issues.
  - Retrying allows the operation to succeed once connectivity is restored.
  - PyMongo is designed to work with retryable reads and writes.
  wrong_why:
    B: Ignoring the error can lead to data loss or inconsistent application behavior.
    C: Batch size has no effect on connection timeouts.
    D: Disabling connection pooling reduces performance and does not solve timeouts.
  trap: 'Assuming connection timeouts are harmless and can be ignored.

    '
  mini_demo: "from pymongo import MongoClient, errors\n\ntry:\n    db.collection.find_one()\nexcept errors.ConnectionFailure:\n\
    \    # retry logic here\n    print(\"Retrying operation...\")\n"
