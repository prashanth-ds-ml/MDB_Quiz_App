prompt: 'What is the relationship between the MongoDB database and MongoDB Atlas?

  '
context: 'MongoDB provides both a core database product and a managed cloud platform. Understanding how these two
  relate is essential for deployment and architecture decisions.

  '

  sample_docs: []
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS).
  - The MongoDB database (server) is the core engine used by Atlas and self-managed deployments.
  - Atlas runs MongoDB for you on AWS, Azure, or GCP.
choices:
- key: A
  text: The MongoDB database is the locally deployed version of MongoDB Atlas.
- key: B
  text: The MongoDB database is a core element of MongoDB Atlas, which is a multi-cloud developer data platform.
- key: C
  text: The MongoDB database is the free version of MongoDB Atlas.
- key: D
  text: MongoDB Atlas is a lightweight client tool used to manage local MongoDB databases.
answer:
  keys:
  - B
rationale:
  rule: 'Atlas = managed platform built on top of the MongoDB database engine.

    '
  correct_why:
  - MongoDB is the core database engine that stores and queries data.
  - MongoDB Atlas is a managed service that runs MongoDB for you on cloud providers.
  - Atlas adds features like backups, scaling, monitoring, and security on top of MongoDB.
  wrong_why:
    A: Atlas is not something that runs locally; it is a cloud-managed service.
    C: MongoDB itself is not a 'free version' of Atlas; both free and paid tiers exist in Atlas.
    D: Atlas is not a client tool; it is a full database platform.
  trap: 'Confusing MongoDB (the database engine) with MongoDB Atlas (the managed cloud service).

    '
  mini_demo: '# MongoDB can run locally:

    mongod --dbpath /data/db


    # MongoDB Atlas runs the same MongoDB engine,

    # but MongoDB Inc manages the infrastructure for you.
