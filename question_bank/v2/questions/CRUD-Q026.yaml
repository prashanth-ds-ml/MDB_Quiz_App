    business_name: AIR FRANCE
    date: Jun 9, 2015
    result: Fail
    sector: Travel Agency - 440

      city: JAMAICA
      zip: 11430
      street: JFK INTL AIRPORT BLVD
      number: 1
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - The `result` field is a scalar string field.
  - Only the inspection outcome needs to be changed.
  - Other fields must remain unchanged.
choices:
- key: A
  text: '{ $set: { result: "Pass" } }'
- key: B
  text: '{ $upsert: { result: "Pass" } }'
- key: C
  text: '{ $insert: { result: "Pass" } }'
- key: D
  text: '{ $push: { result: "Pass" } }'
answer:
  keys:
  - A
rationale:
  rule: 'Use $set to update the value of an existing scalar field.

    '
  correct_why:
  - '`$set` updates only the specified field.'
  - The existing `result` field is safely changed from `Fail` to `Pass`.
  - All other document fields remain untouched.
  wrong_why:
    B: '`upsert` is an option, not an update operator.'
    C: '`$insert` is not a valid MongoDB update operator.'
    D: '`$push` is used only for array fields, not scalar values.'
  trap: 'Confusing update operators with update options or array operators.
