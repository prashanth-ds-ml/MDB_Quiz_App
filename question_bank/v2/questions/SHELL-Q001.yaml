prompt: 'In mongosh, which feature is used to catch errors?

  '
context: 'The MongoDB Shell (mongosh) is based on JavaScript and follows JavaScript error-handling semantics.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs: []
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - mongosh uses JavaScript syntax.
  - Error handling follows standard JavaScript patterns.
choices:
- key: A
  text: try…except
- key: B
  text: try…catch
- key: C
  text: onError
- key: D
  text: errorHandler
answer:
  keys:
  - B
rationale:
  rule: 'mongosh follows JavaScript syntax, which uses try…catch for error handling.

    '
  correct_why:
  - mongosh is built on JavaScript, not Python.
  - JavaScript uses try…catch blocks to handle exceptions.
  - This is the correct and supported way to catch errors in mongosh.
  wrong_why:
    A: try…except is Python syntax, not JavaScript.
    C: onError is not a valid mongosh or JavaScript construct.
    D: errorHandler is not a built-in error-handling feature in mongosh.
  trap: 'Confusing Python (`try…except`) with JavaScript (`try…catch`) syntax.
