prompt: 'What type should be used to store a nested object within a document?

  '
context: 'You are designing a MongoDB document that contains structured data grouped logically under a single field
  (for example, an address or profile).

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs:
  - name: Alice
    address:
      city: Hyderabad
      pincode: '500001'
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - MongoDB documents can contain other documents.
  - This pattern is called embedding and is core to MongoDB’s data model.
choices:
- key: A
  text: Array
- key: B
  text: Embedded Document
- key: C
  text: String
- key: D
  text: Binary
answer:
  keys:
  - B
rationale:
  rule: 'Use an embedded document to store structured, nested data.

    '
  correct_why:
  - Embedded documents allow related fields to be grouped together.
  - They preserve structure and enable dot-notation queries.
  - This is the recommended approach for nested objects in MongoDB.
  wrong_why:
    A: Arrays are used for lists of values, not structured key–value objects.
    C: Strings cannot represent structured nested data.
    D: Binary is used for raw binary data, not documents.
  trap: 'Confusing arrays of values with embedded documents that store structured objects.
