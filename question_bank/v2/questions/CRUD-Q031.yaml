prompt: 'Air Berlin has filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. You need to update the routes collection to
  delete all documents that contain an airline name of Air Berlin. Which of the following queries should you use?
  (Select one.)

  '
context: 'The documents are stored in the `routes` collection.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs:
  - _id: ObjectId('5f6a...')
    airline:
      name: Air Berlin
    src_airport: TXL
    dst_airport: LHR
  notes:
  - Multiple routes may exist for a single airline.
  - Nested fields require dot notation.
choices:
- key: A
  text: "db.routes.deleteOne({\n  \"airline.name\": \"Air Berlin\"\n})\n"
- key: B
  text: 'db.routes.delete("Air Berlin")

    '
- key: C
  text: "db.routes.deleteMany({\n  \"airline.name\": \"Air Berlin\"\n})\n"
- key: D
  text: 'db.routes.deleteMany("Air Berlin")

    '
answer:
  keys:
  - C
rationale:
  rule: 'Use deleteMany() when removing all documents that match a condition.

    '
  correct_why:
  - Multiple routes can belong to the same airline.
  - deleteMany() removes all matching documents.
  - The filter correctly targets the nested airline name.
  wrong_why:
    A: deleteOne() removes only a single matching document.
    B: '`delete()` is not a valid MongoDB method.'
    D: deleteMany() requires a filter document, not a string.
  trap: 'Using deleteOne() when the question explicitly says delete ALL documents.
