prompt: 'If we don’t want to return the `_id` field, we can add it to the projection document and set it to which
  of the following values? (Select all that apply.)

  '
context: 'MongoDB includes the `_id` field by default in query results unless it is explicitly excluded.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs:
  - _id: 1
    name: Alice
    age: 30
  notes:
  - '`_id` is included by default.'
  - Projection values must be numeric.
choices:
- key: A
  text: '0'
- key: B
  text: '1'
- key: C
  text: '-1'
- key: D
  text: None of the above
answer:
  keys:
  - A
rationale:
  rule: 'The `_id` field can be excluded from query results only by setting its value to 0 in the projection document.

    '
  correct_why:
  - Setting `_id` to 0 explicitly excludes it from the result.
  - '`_id` is the only field that can be excluded alongside inclusion projections.'
  wrong_why:
    B: A value of 1 includes the field instead of excluding it.
    C: -1 is not a valid projection value.
    D: A valid value (0) exists to exclude the `_id` field.
  trap: 'Assuming that values other than 0 can be used to exclude `_id`.

    '
  mini_demo: '// Exclude _id

    db.users.find({}, { _id: 0 })


    // Include _id (default behavior)

    db.users.find({}, { name: 1 })
