prompt: 'Which of the following statements are true about the countDocuments() collection method? (Select all that
  apply.)

  '
context: 'You want to count documents in a collection using filters and query operators.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs:
  - _id: 1
    status: active
    age: 25
  - _id: 2
    status: inactive
    age: 17
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - countDocuments(filter) returns an exact count.
  - An empty filter {} counts all documents.
choices:
- key: A
  text: The method takes a query (filter) parameter, which selects the documents to be counted.
- key: B
  text: We can use the method to count all documents in a collection.
- key: C
  text: The method does not support the use of operators in queries that are passed as a parameter.
- key: D
  text: The method returns the matching documents (a cursor), and you count them by iterating.
answer:
  keys:
  - A
  - B
rationale:
  rule: 'countDocuments(filter) counts matching documents; operators like $gte/$in are supported; {} counts all.

    '
  correct_why:
  - 'A is true: the filter decides what gets counted.'
  - 'B is true: using {} counts every document in the collection.'
  wrong_why:
    C: 'False: query operators are supported in countDocuments() filters.'
    D: 'False: countDocuments() returns a number, not a cursor.'
  trap: 'Confusing countDocuments() with find() (cursor) or thinking operators don''t work in counts.
