prompt: 'Which update command would you use to modify only certain fields in a document without removing the other
  existing fields?

  '
context: 'You want to safely update part of a document while preserving all other fields.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs: []
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - Update operators modify specific fields.
  - Replacement updates overwrite the entire document.
choices:
- key: A
  text: replaceOne() with partial document
- key: B
  text: updateOne() with $set operator
- key: C
  text: updateOne() with full document replacement
- key: D
  text: updateMany() without update operators
answer:
  keys:
  - B
rationale:
  rule: 'Use update operators like $set to change specific fields safely.

    '
  correct_why:
  - $set updates only the specified fields.
  - All other fields in the document remain unchanged.
  - This is the recommended and safest way to perform partial updates.
  wrong_why:
    A: replaceOne() replaces the entire document, removing omitted fields.
    C: Full document replacement overwrites all existing fields.
    D: Updates without operators trigger full document replacement.
  trap: 'Thinking that providing a partial document automatically performs a partial update.
