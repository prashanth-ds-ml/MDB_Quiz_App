prompt: 'What methods are available in MongoDB for finding documents?

  '
context: 'You are working in the MongoDB Shell (mongosh) and need to retrieve documents from a collection.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs: []
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - find() is the primary method used to retrieve documents.
  - findOne() also exists, but find() returns a cursor and can match multiple documents.
  - Methods like query() or search() are not MongoDB Shell methods.
choices:
- key: A
  text: .find()
- key: B
  text: .query()
- key: C
  text: .finding()
- key: D
  text: .search()
answer:
  keys:
  - A
rationale:
  rule: 'To retrieve documents → use find().

    '
  correct_why:
  - find() is a valid MongoDB Shell method for retrieving documents.
  - It can return zero, one, or many documents depending on the query.
  - This is the foundational read operation in MongoDB CRUD.
  wrong_why:
    B: query() is not a MongoDB Shell method.
    C: finding() does not exist in the MongoDB API.
    D: search() is related to Atlas Search, not basic document retrieval.
  trap: 'Confusing Atlas Search terminology with basic CRUD read operations.
