prompt: 'A bank has identified a fraudulent account with the account_id MDB905411541. Given the Python file below,
  which expression should you use to remove this account? (Select one.)

  '
context: '# Get reference to ''bank'' database

  db = client.bank


  # Get a reference to the ''accounts'' collection

  accounts_collection = db.accounts


  # Filter by account_id

  fraud_account = { "account_id": "MDB905411541" }


  # Select an expression that deletes the target account.

  - account_id: MDB905411541
    account_holder: Fraudulent User
    account_type: checking
    balance: 0.0
  notes:
  - Use delete_one() when exactly one document must be removed.
  - delete() and hide() are not valid PyMongo collection methods.
choices:
- key: A
  text: 'result = accounts_collection.delete(fraud_account)

    '
- key: B
  text: 'result = accounts_collection.hide(fraud_account)

    '
- key: C
  text: 'result = accounts_collection.delete(account)

    '
- key: D
  text: 'result = accounts_collection.delete_one(fraud_account)

    '
answer:
  keys:
  - D
rationale:
  rule: 'The delete_one() method removes exactly one document that matches the given filter document.

    '
  correct_why:
  - delete_one() is the correct PyMongo method for deleting a single document.
  - The filter fraud_account correctly matches the target account_id.
  - The operation removes only the fraudulent account.
  wrong_why:
    A: delete() is not a valid method in PyMongo.
    B: hide() is not a MongoDB or PyMongo operation.
    C: The variable 'account' is not defined in the given context.
  trap: 'A common exam trap is using non-existent methods like delete() instead of the valid delete_one() or delete_many()
    APIs.
