prompt: 'What methods are available in MongoDB for inserting a single document?

  '
context: 'You are working in the MongoDB Shell (mongosh) and need to add exactly one document to a collection.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs: []
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - insertOne() is the standard and recommended method to insert a single document.
  - insertMany() is used only when inserting multiple documents.

choices:
- key: A
  text: .insertOne()
- key: B
  text: .inserting()
- key: C
  text: .InsertDocument()
- key: D
  text: .insertMany()
answer:
  keys:
  - A
rationale:
  rule: 'One document → insertOne(), many documents → insertMany().

    '
  correct_why:
  - insertOne() is a valid MongoDB Shell method for inserting exactly one document.
  - It returns an acknowledgment with the inserted _id.
  - This method is explicitly tested in CRUD basics for the Associate exam.
  wrong_why:
    B: inserting() is not a MongoDB Shell method.
    C: InsertDocument() is not a valid MongoDB API method.
    D: insertMany() is used only for inserting multiple documents, not a single one.
  trap: 'Confusing insertMany() with insertOne() because both insert documents.
