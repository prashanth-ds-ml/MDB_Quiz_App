prompt: 'Which of the following statements are true about a projection document? (Select all that apply.)

  '
context: 'You are querying documents using the find() method and want to control which fields are returned in the
  result set.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs:
  - _id: 1
    name: Alice
    age: 30
    email: alice@example.com
  notes:
  - Projection controls which fields are returned by a query.
  - '`_id` is included by default unless explicitly excluded.'
choices:
- key: A
  text: 'We can include fields in our results by setting their values to 1 in the projection document.

    '
- key: B
  text: 'We can exclude fields from our results by setting their values to 0 in the projection document.

    '
- key: C
  text: 'We can either include or exclude fields in the results, but not both. The `_id` field is the exception
    to this rule.

    '
- key: D
  text: 'Inclusion and exclusion statements, not including `_id` statements, can be combined with each other in
    a projection document.

    '
answer:
  keys:
  - A
  - B
  - C
rationale:
  rule: 'A projection document may either include fields or exclude fields, but not both at the same time, except
    for the `_id` field.

    '
  correct_why:
  - Setting a field to 1 includes it in the result.
  - Setting a field to 0 excludes it from the result.
  - MongoDB does not allow mixing inclusion and exclusion, except for `_id`.
  wrong_why:
    D: 'MongoDB does not allow inclusion and exclusion statements to be mixed in the same projection document. The
      only exception is the `_id` field.

      '
  trap: 'Many assume that inclusion and exclusion can be mixed freely, which is false. `_id` is the only field that
    can be excluded alongside inclusion projections.

    '
  mini_demo: '// Valid inclusion

    db.users.find({}, { name: 1, age: 1 })


    // Valid exclusion

    db.users.find({}, { email: 0 })


    // Valid: _id excluded with inclusion

    db.users.find({}, { name: 1, _id: 0 })


    // Invalid: mixing inclusion and exclusion

    // db.users.find({}, { name: 1, age: 0 })
