  - account_id: MDB156014571
    account_holder: Adelen Værnes
    account_type: savings

    account_type: savings
  - account_id: MDB870205338
    account_holder: Juan Perez
    account_type: checking
  notes:
  - delete_many() removes entire documents, not individual fields.
  - The filter matches documents where account_type is 'checking'.
choices:
- key: A
  text: Louis Lewis and Adelen Værnes are the only two documents left in the collection.
- key: B
  text: Juan Perez is the only document left in the collection.
- key: C
  text: No changes happen to the collection.
- key: D
  text: The account_type field is removed from all documents.
answer:
  keys:
  - A
rationale:
  rule: 'delete_many() deletes all documents that match the given filter.

    '
  correct_why:
  - Only Juan Perez has account_type set to 'checking'.
  - That document matches the filter and is deleted.
  - The two savings accounts remain in the collection.
  wrong_why:
    B: Juan Perez is deleted, so he cannot be the only document remaining.
    C: A matching document exists, so the collection is modified.
    D: Field removal requires $unset, not delete_many().
  trap: 'A common exam trap is confusing document deletion (delete_many) with field deletion using $unset.
