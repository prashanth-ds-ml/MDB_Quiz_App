prompt: 'What can we expect to be returned by running db.inspections.countDocuments({})? (Select one.)

  '
context: 'You are working with the inspections collection inside the sample_training database.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs:
  - _id: 1
    result: Pass
  - _id: 2
    result: Fail
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - An empty filter {} matches all documents.
  - countDocuments() returns a number.
choices:
- key: A
  text: 'This command does not return anything because it requires a query parameter.

    '
- key: B
  text: 'This command returns the total number of documents in the inspections database.

    '
- key: C
  text: 'This command returns the total number of documents in the inspections collection.

    '
- key: D
  text: 'This command returns a cursor containing all inspection documents.

    '
answer:
  keys:
  - C
rationale:
  rule: 'countDocuments({}) counts all documents in the collection and returns a number.

    '
  correct_why:
  - The empty filter {} matches all documents.
  - countDocuments() always returns a numeric count.
  - The method is executed on the inspections collection.
  wrong_why:
    A: An empty document {} is a valid query parameter.
    B: The method counts documents in a collection, not an entire database.
    D: countDocuments() returns a number, not a cursor.
  trap: 'A common exam trap is confusing database-level scope with collection-level scope.
