prompt: 'Why should you avoid inserting documents with missing required fields?

  '
context: 'You are designing an application that relies on consistent data for querying, reporting, and analytics.

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs: []
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - MongoDB allows missing fields unless schema validation is enforced.
  - Application logic often assumes certain fields exist.
choices:
- key: A
  text: MongoDB rejects the insert
- key: B
  text: Your queries or reports might fail or give inaccurate results
- key: C
  text: The document becomes automatically deleted
- key: D
  text: Indexes stop working on the collection
answer:
  keys:
  - B
rationale:
  rule: 'Missing fields can break assumptions made by queries and applications.

    '
  correct_why:
  - Queries may return incomplete or misleading results.
  - Aggregations and reports may fail or produce incorrect metrics.
  - Application code often expects certain fields to exist.
  wrong_why:
    A: MongoDB accepts documents with missing fields unless validation is enabled.
    C: MongoDB never auto-deletes documents due to missing fields.
    D: Indexes continue to work, but results may be incomplete.
  trap: 'Assuming MongoDB automatically enforces required fields by default.

    '
  mini_demo: '// Query expecting ''price'' may miss documents without it

    db.products.find({ price: { $gt: 1000 } })
