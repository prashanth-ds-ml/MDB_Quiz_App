prompt: 'What is the main benefit of MongoDB’s schema flexibility?

  '
context: 'You are comparing MongoDB’s document model with traditional relational databases during application design.

  '

  snippets: []
  notes:
  - Schema flexibility allows documents with different shapes.
  - This reduces friction during iterative development.
choices:
- key: A
  text: Requires schema migrations for every change
- key: B
  text: Supports polymorphic data and quicker development
- key: C
  text: Enforces strict data types
- key: D
  text: Requires all documents to follow the same structure
answer:
  keys:
  - B
rationale:
  rule: 'Schema flexibility enables polymorphic documents and faster iteration.

    '
  correct_why:
  - Different document shapes can coexist in the same collection.
  - Developers can evolve the data model without costly migrations.
  - This speeds up development and supports agile workflows.
  wrong_why:
    A: MongoDB does not require schema migrations for every change.
    C: MongoDB does not enforce strict schemas by default.
    D: Collections do not require uniform document structures.
  trap: 'Confusing MongoDB’s flexible schema with rigid relational schemas.
