prompt: 'You want to know which mobile food trucks in your neighborhood, Astoria, are the best spots to eat. Using
  the `inspections` collection, you are making a map of all mobile food trucks nearby that have passed inspection.
  What should you include in your query document to ensure that you find all the mobile food vendors in Astoria
  that passed inspection?

  '
context: 'Each document includes fields for `sector`, `address.city`, and `result`.

  notes:
  - MongoDB applies an implicit AND when multiple fields are specified in a query document.
  - You only need $and when combining multiple conditions on the same field or using complex expressions.
choices:
- key: A
  text: '{ "sector": "Mobile Food Vendor - 881" }, { "address.city": "ASTORIA" }, { "result": "Pass" }'
- key: B
  text: '$and: { "Mobile Food Vendor - 881", "ASTORIA", "Pass" }'
- key: C
  text: '{ "sector": "Mobile Food Vendor - 881", "address.city": "ASTORIA", "result": "Pass" }'
- key: D
  text: '&and: { "Mobile Food Vendor - 881", "ASTORIA", "Pass" }'
answer:
  keys:
  - C
rationale:
  rule: 'Multiple field conditions in a query document are combined using an implicit AND.

    '
  correct_why:
  - Specifying multiple fields in a single query document applies AND logic automatically.
  - This query correctly filters by sector, city, and inspection result.
  - This is the simplest and most idiomatic MongoDB query for this use case.
  wrong_why:
    A: Multiple query documents separated by commas is not valid MongoDB syntax.
    B: $and requires an array of expressions, not raw values.
    D: '&and is not a valid MongoDB operator.'
  trap: 'Assuming $and is required for every multi-condition query, when MongoDB already applies AND logic implicitly.
