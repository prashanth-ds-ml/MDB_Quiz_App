prompt: 'Which query returns only the `name` field while excluding `_id`?

  sample_docs:
  - _id: 1
    name: Alice
    age: 30
  - _id: 2
    name: Bob
    age: 25
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - '`_id` is included by default in all find() results.'
  - '`_id` is the only field that can be excluded while including others.'
choices:
- key: A
  text: 'db.users.find({}, { name: 1 })'
- key: B
  text: 'db.users.find({}, { name: 1, _id: 0 })'
- key: C
  text: 'db.users.find({}, { name: 1, _id: -1 })'
- key: D
  text: 'db.users.find({}, { name: true })'
answer:
  keys:
  - B
rationale:
  rule: '`_id` is included by default and must be explicitly excluded using `_id: 0`.

    '
  correct_why:
  - '`name: 1` includes only the name field.'
  - '`_id: 0` explicitly removes `_id` from the result.'
  - This follows MongoDB’s projection inclusion rules.
  wrong_why:
    A: '`_id` is included by default, so it will still appear in the result.'
    C: '`_id: -1` is not a valid projection value.'
    D: '`true` behaves like `1`, so `_id` is still included unless explicitly excluded.'
  trap: 'Assuming that projecting a single field automatically removes `_id`.

    '
  mini_demo: 'db.users.find({}, { name: 1 }).limit(1)

    // Result: { _id: ObjectId(...), name: "Alice" }


    db.users.find({}, { name: 1, _id: 0 }).limit(1)

    // Result: { name: "Alice" }
