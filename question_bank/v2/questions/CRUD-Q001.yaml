prompt: >
  Which query returns only the `name` field while excluding `_id`?

context: >
  You want a minimal response payload when reading user profiles.

  sample_docs:
    - { "_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "age": 30 }
    - { "_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "age": 25 }
  snippets: []
  notes:
    - "MongoDB includes `_id` by default unless excluded."

choices:
  - key: "A"
    text: 'db.users.find({}, { name: 1 })'
  - key: "B"
    text: 'db.users.find({}, { name: 1, _id: 0 })'
  - key: "C"
    text: 'db.users.find({}, { name: 1, _id: -1 })'
  - key: "D"
    text: 'db.users.find({}, { name: true })'

answer:
  keys: ["B"]

rationale:
  rule: >
    In projections, `_id` is included by default unless you explicitly exclude it with `_id: 0`.

  correct_why:
    - "`name: 1` includes the name field."
    - "`_id: 0` explicitly excludes `_id`."

  wrong_why:
    A: "`_id` is included by default, so `_id` still appears."
    C: "`_id: -1` is not a valid way to exclude `_id` in projection."
    D: "Boolean projections still include `_id` unless excluded."

  trap: >
    Many assume projecting only one field automatically removes `_id`, which is false.

  mini_demo: |
    db.users.find({}, { name: 1 }).limit(1)
    // -> { _id: ObjectId(...), name: "Alice" }

    db.users.find({}, { name: 1, _id: 0 }).limit(1)
    // -> { name: "Alice" }
