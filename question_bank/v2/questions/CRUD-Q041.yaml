prompt: 'The sample_restaurants database is expanding to include restaurants in 5 new neighborhoods. You need to
  add documents for the 5 new neighborhoods in the neighborhoods collection. Documents for each new neighborhood
  are stored in the neighborhood_update variable. Which expression should you use to insert these documents into
  the collection? (Select one.)

  '
context: 'neighborhood_update contains five neighborhood documents (a Python list of dicts).

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs:
  - name: Downtown
    borough: Manhattan
  - name: Midtown
    borough: Manhattan
  - name: Uptown
    borough: Manhattan
  - name: Old Town
    borough: Queens
  - name: Riverside
    borough: Brooklyn
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - insert_one() → single dict
  - insert_many() → list of dicts
  - PyMongo has no collection.insert() method
choices:
- key: A
  text: 'result = neighborhoods_collection.insert_one(neighborhood_update)

    '
- key: B
  text: 'result = neighborhoods_collection.insert_many(neighborhood_update)

    '
- key: C
  text: 'result = neighborhoods_collection.insert(neighborhood_update)

    '
- key: D
  text: "result = neighborhoods_collection.insert_one([\n  neighborhood_one,\n  neighborhood_two,\n  neighborhood_three,\n\
    \  neighborhood_four,\n  neighborhood_five\n])\n"
answer:
  keys:
  - B
rationale:
  rule: 'Use insert_many(list_of_documents) when inserting multiple documents at once.

    '
  correct_why:
  - neighborhood_update is a list of documents.
  - insert_many() accepts a list and inserts all documents.
  wrong_why:
    A: insert_one() expects a single document (dict), not a list of documents.
    C: insert() is not a valid PyMongo collection method.
    D: insert_one() cannot insert a list of documents.
  trap: 'Many confuse “one variable” with “one document”. Here the variable holds multiple docs.
