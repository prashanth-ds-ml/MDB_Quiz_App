prompt: 'Which of the following operators can be used to find a subdocument that matches specific criteria in an
  array?

  '
context: 'You are querying an array field that contains embedded documents and need to ensure multiple conditions
  apply to the same array element.

  '

  sample_docs:
  - _id: 1
    scores:
    - type: math
      score: 85
    - type: english
      score: 92
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - $elemMatch ensures that multiple conditions apply to the same array element.
  - Without $elemMatch, conditions may match different elements in the array.
choices:
- key: A
  text: '&element'
- key: B
  text: $elemMatch
- key: C
  text: $subMatch
- key: D
  text: $docMatch
answer:
  keys:
  - B
rationale:
  rule: 'Use $elemMatch when multiple conditions must match the same array element.

    '
  correct_why:
  - $elemMatch is the official MongoDB operator for matching subdocuments in arrays.
  - It guarantees all criteria are evaluated against a single array element.
  - This operator is heavily tested in array-query exam questions.
  wrong_why:
    A: '&element is not a valid MongoDB operator.'
    C: $subMatch does not exist in MongoDB.
    D: $docMatch is not a valid MongoDB query operator.
  trap: 'Forgetting $elemMatch and unintentionally matching conditions across different elements of the same array.
