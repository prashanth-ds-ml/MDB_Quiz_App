prompt: 'Which BSON type is best for storing precise monetary values?

  '
context: 'You are designing a schema that stores currency amounts where rounding errors must be avoided (for example,
  prices, balances, or financial data).

  '
artifacts:
  sample_docs: []
  snippets: []
  notes:
  - Floating-point types can introduce rounding errors.
  - MongoDB provides a high-precision decimal type specifically for financial data.
choices:
- key: A
  text: Double
- key: B
  text: Decimal128
- key: C
  text: String
- key: D
  text: Int32
answer:
  keys:
  - B
rationale:
  rule: 'Use Decimal128 for exact precision when storing monetary values.

    '
  correct_why:
  - Decimal128 stores decimal floating-point values with high precision.
  - It avoids rounding errors common with binary floating-point types like Double.
  - MongoDB explicitly recommends Decimal128 for financial calculations.
  wrong_why:
    A: Double is a binary floating-point type and can introduce rounding errors.
    C: String cannot be used for numeric calculations without conversion.
    D: Int32 cannot represent fractional monetary values.
  trap: 'Using Double for money, which can silently introduce precision errors.
